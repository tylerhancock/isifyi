				<h3 class="font-lg">We built this series of prototypes to dispel a few common assumptions about the way we currently treat risk information in digital products. Our goal in showing these designs is to reduce the physical space that risk information occupies without reducing the fair balance.</h3>

				<h3 class="font-sm">"For a piece to be accurate and non-misleading, risk information should be included in the main part of a piece. If the omission of risk information in any part of a piece makes that part of the piece false or misleading, the problem cannot be corrected simply by including the risk information in a separate part ofthe piece. To be comparably prominent to benefit information, risk information should generally appear in the same parts of the piece as the benefits." – <i>C. Considerations of Format, Lines 545-549</i></h3>

				<h3 class="font-sm">"Complete separation of benefit and risk information (e.g., presenting several pages of benefits before any risks) is one example of a lack of appropriate prominence. FDA will also look to see that risk information is not placed in such a way as to interfere with readers’ perceptions of the relative importance or utility of the information." – <i>C.

				<p class="font-md">In this demo, we use a bounce animation to draw the user's attention to the appropriate risk information. This sort of interaction is common practice for digital reminders and unread messages. The bouncing reminder could be replayed each time a user visits a new page, or if contextual risk information is presented.</p>

				<p class="font-md">Here we use color to strike a visual balance between the website's interface and the risk information. The consistency in color means the risk information is not completely separated from the benefit information. The balance also means the color treatment does not negatively influence "readers’ perceptions of the relative importance".</p>

				<p class="font-md">In this demo, we use a compressing animation to strike a visual balance between risk and benefit information. When a user first lands on a page, the risk information is presented in a large tray, but it slowly compresses after they have had the opportunity to read through the content.</p>
